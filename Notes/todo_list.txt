Todo List:

Investigate remaining text-box speed-up issues better. Currently it looks like we may have to live with tiny amounts of slow text.

Figure out why Wii VC is stupid. Convince someone with an everdrive to test for us.

Make progressives work with great fairies. May be deferred to post-1.0.

Deferred to post-1.0:

Figure out a good way to add Biggoron Sword to the shuffle.

Recode great fairies substantially for the following ideal behavior (note: Likely post 1.0, seems VERY difficult):

-Three of the six great fairies (selected randomly) give items. Zelda's Lullaby is required to activate the item get scene but a magic meter is no longer required.

-Two of the six great fairies upgrade magic. The first the player encounters is the normal magic meter and the second is double magic in a progressive fashion.

-The last great fairy doubles Link's life meter, again with no magic meter requirement.

-This will require randomizing the items, randomizing which fairy has which behavior, removing magic meter requirements, and doing some substantial tweaking of the magic granting fairies to allow the meters to be progressive. This will, however, give significantly better play experience as the player can just get things from the fairy fountains reliably upon going inside with Lullaby, and having two chances to get a magic meter will significantly reduce the pain of hunting that down.
