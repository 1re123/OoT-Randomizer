Todo List:

Implement mechanical support for the All Dungeons Rainbow Bridge setting.

Clean up the code to remove various artifacts from lttpr. Likely just remove all the entrance shuffle stuff as it's not coming anytime soon if I'm being real.

Finish progressive item code for gfx of held up item.

Implement text box speedups, removing as many as possible slower character drawing, disables of instant text, and disables of B button text scrolling as possible.

Deferred to post-1.0:

Figure out a good way to add Biggoron Sword to the shuffle.

Recode great fairies substantially for the following ideal behavior (note: Likely post 1.0, seems VERY difficult):

-Three of the six great fairies (selected randomly) give items. Zelda's Lullaby is required to activate the item get scene but a magic meter is no longer required.

-Two of the six great fairies upgrade magic. The first the player encounters is the normal magic meter and the second is double magic in a progressive fashion.

-The last great fairy doubles Link's life meter, again with no magic meter requirement.

-This will require randomizing the items, randomizing which fairy has which behavior, removing magic meter requirements, and doing some substantial tweaking of the magic granting fairies to allow the meters to be progressive. This will, however, give significantly better play experience as the player can just get things from the fairy fountains reliably upon going inside with Lullaby, and having two chances to get a magic meter will significantly reduce the pain of hunting that down.
