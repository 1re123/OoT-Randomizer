Todo List:

Address the shuffle of Zelda's Light Arrows, Treasure Chest game, and the Great Fairy spells. They will require some careful and unique handling.

Remove as many cutscenes as possible to speed gameplay. An area in ROM to target is 0xB06C1C (RAM 0x80090CBC). For note, 0xA6 is the first instruction in SH as opposed to 0xA2 for SB; it will be necessary to condense some other functions to make room. Need to document all flags for owls, navi, and other pointless cutscenes.

Implement ROM side mechanics necessary for the Rainbow Bridge requirement dropdown to have correct mechanical function.

Implement an "Open Door of Time" flag.

Allow bombs to be purchased and bombchu bowling to be played if a bomb bag is owned instead of if Goron Ruby is held. Grant Man's pull request should be examined carefully as it addresses this point.

Clean up the code to remove various artifacts from lttpr. Likely just remove all the entrance shuffle stuff as it's not coming anytime soon if I'm being real. Write a new README.

Deferred to post-1.0:

Finish progressive item code for gfx of held up item. Shift code to 0x803AF1C0 to remove expansion pak requirement and write code into RAM sometime when loading the game instead of relying on gameshark cheat hack.

Add a flag for no subscreen delay on ROM side.

Likely will have to deal with checksum correction at some point.

Recode great fairies substantially for the following ideal behavior (note: Likely post 1.0, seems VERY difficult):

-Three of the six great fairies (selected randomly) give items. Zelda's Lullaby is required to activate the item get scene but a magic meter is no longer required.

-Two of the six great fairies upgrade magic. The first the player encounters is the normal magic meter and the second is double magic in a progressive fashion.

-The last great fairy doubles Link's life meter, again with no magic meter requirement.

-This will require randomizing the items, randomizing which fairy has which behavior, removing magic meter requirements, and doing some substantial tweaking of the magic granting fairies to allow the meters to be progressive. This will, however, give significantly better play experience as the player can just get things from the fairy fountains reliably upon going inside with Lullaby, and having two chances to get a magic meter will significantly reduce the pain of hunting that down.
